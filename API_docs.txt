TATOR TOT API Docs: 


This document is a brief summary of all the API Endpoints for our TatorTo Kids Club App. Following are some API Endpoints along with brief descriptions: 

Note -:- Instead of real domain, we are going to use localhost:8000 for sake of simplicity. 

Note -:- This API can only be used by the templates(html files) inside our App. Remote Origin are not allowed by us. Coz this is not a Headless CMS. In our App frontend is tightly binded to backend. Also these are just few API Endpoints of our API. Not all of them are included. Just to give a basic idea.
